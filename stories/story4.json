        "In a sunlit park, a teenage boy slumps on a wooden bench, clutching a crumpled F-grade exam paper, autumn leaves falling around his downcast face.",
        "Close up, the boy grips his hair in frustration, dark thoughts swirling visibly around him, his expression twisted with self-doubt and anxiety.",
        "At the bench, the boy holds a smartphone displaying a mindfulness app, his furrowed brows showing internal conflict as he considers his choices.",
        "Under a cherry tree, the boy sits cross-legged with eyes closed, golden breathing lines visible, his expression peaceful as sunlight filters through.",
        "On the grass, the boy smiles softly at his exam paper, surrounded by blooming flowers, his phone showing meditation progress nearby."
